# What you need to get started:

* An Android Smartphone with Android 5.0 or later. See [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZAsN6f0gv6tkgy9EBsYl0BQNhna0RDqA9QGycAqCQc/edit?usp=sharing) for user reports on how well a particular phone works with AndroidAPS. If you are using an Accu-Chek Combo pump you will need to be running LineageOS 14.1 or Android 8.1 or later to be able to successfully pair the phone and the pump.
* A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data source: Dexcom G4/G5/G6, Freestyle Libre, Eversense or Medtronic Guardian
* An app to receive data from your CGM and interface with AndroidAPS such as: [xDrip](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/), [xDrip+](https://github.com/jamorham/xDrip-plus), [Glimp](http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/welcome/nightscout-for-libre),  [600SeriesAndroidUploader](https://github.com/pazaan/600SeriesAndroidUploader)
* The [AndroidAPS](https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS) app itself. This is provided as a source code which you will need to compile using Android Studio before it can be loaded onto your Android phone.
* [Nightscout](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor>) 0.10.2 or later
* A supported pump: a SOOIL Dana-R, Dana-RS Insulin Pump or a Roche Accu-Chek Combo. Other pumps may be possible but would require the necessary drivers to be written.
