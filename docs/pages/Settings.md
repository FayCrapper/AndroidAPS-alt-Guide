# Understanding the AndroidAPS settings

AndroidAPS has many settings, and they fall into three main categories:
 * Altering the way the app is presented to you and used - for example, showing particular menu items, buttons or other features,
 * Setting up interworking with external devices or apps, like your CGM, your pump, Nightscout and so on,
 * Options which affect the way that insulin is delivered. Some of these will aready be familiar to you like Insulin to Carb ratio, your basal profile and so on. But others are unique to OpenAPS, like the maximum amount of insulin AndroidAPS will deliver.
 
 In most cases the settings are to be found either in the Config Builder under the gear wheel image next to the module you are configuring or in the preferences section.
